How to inherit class from another. How to define a class with multiple base classes. What is the default class every class inherit from. How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class. Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses. What is the purpose of inheritance. What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and superbuilt-in functions.

2. Exact same object - Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False. - 2-is_same_class.py.
3. Same class or inherit from - Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False. - 3-is_kind_of_class.py.
4. Only sub class of - Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False. - 4-inherits_from.py.
